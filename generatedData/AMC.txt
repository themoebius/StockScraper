This ends up hurting existing shareholders, as well as people who hoped to squeeze the short sellers. This is another form of the prisoner\u0027s dilemna.\n\n\nYeah except where GME and AMC were able to  use share price to issue shares and pay down debt and allow for survival and in GME‚Äôs case, a transformation of the company. \n\n\nWithout wsb, AMC would literally be in receivership of some sort.","Lol.

These guys hate on Robinhood but if you have no idea about trade options and want to learn robinhood is the easiest to put a spread and the easiest to understand. These dickheads are going to fuck you out of money because you‚Äôre not even going to understand what you are looking at. Robinhood is fine and many people have made plenty on it. Millions and more. Most of these cucks have no experience investing they just buy gme and amc hoping they will be rich on highs. Even though they are shit companies and the position is short and they will end up with half of their money or less. Do what you think is right","Thanks for the suggestions on the sources.  I am glad to hear your approach to making these types of decisions. \n\nThis is a portfolio that is entirely bonus income, so I am not relying on it for retirement, etc. Still, I did substantial research before deciding I like these companies. For instance, I am looking at the number of hedge funds who are long on the stock, what company insiders are doing regarding selling or buying shares, and reviewing the blogs I mentioned. \n\nI mean, I find red flags with the research I do with other meme stocks, so Tesla, GME, AMC, PLTR, BB are not options.  Red flags were harder to find with these stocks.  \n\nThis weekend, I will enjoy exploring FinViz, Yahoo Financials, and Openinsider.","I just have to ask, AMCs run-up went something like:\n\nDay 1: $14\nDay 2: $18\nDay 3: $22\nDay 4: $32\nDay 5: $31\nDay 6: $65\n\nDid you really see it going up so much and wait a full trading week to buy in at $60? Or was this recently since the price has been hovering around $55-$60?\n\nCan‚Äôt clown you though. The only reason I didn‚Äôt cash out at $13.50 in March was because at the time I was on unemployment, and didn‚Äôt want to risk losing it. As it was paying more than the profits I would make if I were to get cut off. \n\nAnd It was easy for me to hold though as I spent all my money on GME back in feb and used a few bucks on AMC for the hell of it. So unless I saw it go up 1000% or more, taxes would eat so much profit that I may as well just pick up another shift at work.","Long time AMC ape but if this dips to $8 ima load up 10k into it.","$GME and $AMC are the only real memestonks, every other ticker that claims to be a memestock is a p\u0026amp;d","More distractions to keep people from buying GME AMC.","Fact is Burry shorted the American Dream of Home Ownership and made out like a bandit.

Hollywood makes him out to be a hero but he is literally one of the greatest real villains  of all time in America.","WISH isn‚Äôt going anywhere. Wall Street firms got their young brokers to flood this sub with WISH. No one is shorting WISH and no one likes WISH.

AMC will continue to dilute with people like this willing to pay for it.","Game stop might be past and squeeze because the shorts covered but AMC the shorts never covered the stock just went up because people were anticipating it. it‚Äôs still short at like 20%.

You still made money, just not as much as you would\u0027ve had you just owned the stock (granted, with a stock like AMC, you could severely limit your gains, but profit is profit).","Normally if you are selling options that you do not own, you are exposed to a technically infinite amount of risk.

They then pump the stock on WSBs to drive up the call sales and long hedge positions, then short attack it to force a gamma hedge squeeze to the downside. \n\nVery profitable.

I understand the hesitation.

They have already won over the hearts and minds of the enthusiast/gamer market with their last two generations of chips and if intel can\u0027t get it together and match the performance of AMD\u0027s new server chips the big boys that buy millions of dollars of chips at a time for server center deployment are going to follow the gamers out there and leave intel in the dust.
