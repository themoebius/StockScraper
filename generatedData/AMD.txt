Semis are so important in fact, that at this point US Gov should really be looking at INTC/NVD/TI more like they did Ford/GM 100 years ago: as a strategic industrial/military resource. \n\nReal threat to AMD isn\u0027t INTC. INTC was the big market share holder in the past and isn\u0027t likely gaining any ground any time soon. What AMD and all the trad chip manufacturers should fear is FAAAM \u0026amp; BAT. Apple has started designing it\u0027s own chips. They aren\u0027t going back to using outsourced chips. If history says anything it\u0027s that Apple will continue to cut others out as they continue to in-house their chips for their entire lineup while improving their chips just like how they kept improving their computers, just like how the iphone kept improving until NOK/MOT were beat, just like how a good chunk of the watch market is Apple watches, just like how Ipads have taken away from of the laptop space, just like how Apple TV keeps chipping away at cable, just like how the app store and Apple\u0027s eco system keeps growing, etcetcetc. There is nothing AMD/NVD/INTC can do to stop Apple. And Apple is just the first. MSFT also doing the same. Google, Facebook, and Amazon might follow suit. China\u0027s Tencent and Alibaba will likely copy what the US companies do as soon as Pooh Bear gets done man handling them.","Well Robin Hood sold my AMD shares, guess I have to buy more Tuesday.","Just do some basic analysis. The price was sitting at \\~10 dollars for a while, and then shot up to 50 dollars. That\u0027s a 500% increase. Every 1 dollar it moves, you make about 400 dollars. The thing about stocks though is increases are exponential, not linear. In other words, to move 500% from 10 to 50 took about 20 billion dollars, but to move 500% again, it would take 225 billion dollars. That means the likelyhood of this happening is very low. Remember, prices are not objective markers in space. GME going to 500 dollars did not even take 100 billion, it was only valued around 60 at that price and it only lasted for a few seconds. \n\nIf you honestly think a struggling movie company that was on the decline even before Covid is going to be worth more than AMD, a successful processor manufacture who is helping massive corporations like Google and Amazon shape the modern world, then by all means, stay in for the return.

You can put a stop loss and let it ride but that has it\u0027s own associated risk. You can also do as other suggest here and sell calls against these but that also has a downside risk. \n\nYou can try to eek out a few extra thousand by selling to close at a different strike and turning it into a fixed trade, where you stand to for example make an extra xxxk but also lose that much and no matter what you secure some amount of it, but honestly because you are here asking this question in the first place\n\n\u0026amp;#x200B;\n\nStop being fucking retarded and take the 20 grand.","So AMD 93 0dte bought at close yesterday was alright, but I sure wish I’d held onto those 100c leaps I sold last week","After fucking years of talking about it, will AMD finally hit $100?","AMD is gonna soar more than it already has.

Although they\u0027re creating those hybrid big-little equivalents, so maybe it will be used for that.\n\nTSMC are always going to cosy up to AMD/Apple/Nvidia/Qualcomm who aren\u0027t competing with TSMC and are already using up every last nanometre that TSMC can pump out.","Watching ABNB and AMD for the long term purchase.

If history says anything it\u0027s that Apple will continue to cut others out as they continue to in-house their chips for their entire lineup while improving their chips just like how they kept improving their computers, just like how the iphone kept improving until NOK/MOT were beat, just like how a good chunk of the watch market is Apple watches, just like how Ipads have taken away from of the laptop space, just like how Apple TV keeps chipping away at cable, just like how the app store and Apple\u0027s eco system keeps growing, etcetcetc. There is nothing AMD/NVD/INTC can do to stop Apple. And Apple is just the first. MSFT also doing the same. Google, Facebook, and Amazon might follow suit. China\u0027s Tencent and Alibaba will likely copy what the US companies do as soon as Pooh Bear gets done man handling them.","Well Robin Hood sold my AMD shares, guess I have to buy more Tuesday.","Just do some basic analysis. The price was sitting at \\~10 dollars for a while, and then shot up to 50 dollars. That\u0027s a 500% increase. Every 1 dollar it moves, you make about 400 dollars. The thing about stocks though is increases are exponential, not linear. In other words, to move 500% from 10 to 50 took about 20 billion dollars, but to move 500% again, it would take 225 billion dollars. That means the likelyhood of this happening is very low. Remember, prices are not objective markers in space. GME going to 500 dollars did not even take 100 billion, it was only valued around 60 at that price and it only lasted for a few seconds. \n\nIf you honestly think a struggling movie company that was on the decline even before Covid is going to be worth more than AMD, a successful processor manufacture who is helping massive corporations like Google and Amazon shape the modern world, then by all means, stay in for the return. But realistically how much more do you think you are going to get out of this? You made 20 grand. To get another 20 grand you need to risk probably losing at least 15 grand over time minimum. You can put a stop loss and let it ride but that has it\u0027s own associated risk. You can also do as other suggest here and sell calls against these but that also has a downside risk. \n\nYou can try to eek out a few extra thousand by selling to close at a different strike and turning it into a fixed trade, where you stand to for example make an extra xxxk but also lose that much and no matter what you secure some amount of it, but honestly because you are here asking this question in the first place\n\n\u0026amp;#x200B;\n\nStop being fucking retarded and take the 20 grand.","So AMD 93 0dte bought at close yesterday was alright, but I sure wish I’d held onto those 100c leaps I sold last week","After fucking years of talking about it, will AMD finally hit $100?","AMD is gonna soar more than it already has. Also anyone else see the notice from RH saying they would probably freeze trading again? To me it tells me they know what\u0027s coming.","Making a grand a week selling amd calls. Easiest money of my life. Wish I started trading years ago","can AMD face rip again?","A follow up question since I don\u0027t follow these things as closely as I used to:  What does AMD have on a similar horizon?\n\nWe have some information about where Intel is going, especially with the fabrication campus announcement for Arizona.  I doubt AMD is planning on sitting on its hands for the next 3-5 years, but have they released much in the way of timelines or future goals as Intel has?","Buy AMD","PLTR is my heaviest bags. I figured I\u0027d buy and forget like AMD since it seemed like a promising company according to the DD I did, and I consider myself familiar with the tech sector, boy was I wrong. I\u0027ve been slowly DCAing out for a loss, I don\u0027t see it making it\u0027s way back up to my average buy in.","Sorry I don\u0027t know why you were downvoted. I know what you mean though. AMD is a pretty high conviction play for me so I don\u0027t mind owning the shares after 2023, I can sell CCs on them as well and maybe they\u0027ll have dividends then as well. It\u0027s just different for everyone, if it\u0027s something I don\u0027t care to hold, I would just sell after a certain % gain.","AMD is so undervalued man","I agree, it\u0027s unlikely Intel would be able to get enough capacity from TSMC to fulfill their entire line of CPUs or even a significant portion of it. I suspect this will probably be for some super low power laptop/tablet chips and won\u0027t get anywhere near desktop or regular laptops. Although they\u0027re creating those hybrid big-little equivalents, so maybe it will be used for that.\n\nTSMC are always going to cosy up to AMD/Apple/Nvidia/Qualcomm who aren\u0027t competing with TSMC and are already using up every last nanometre that TSMC can pump out.","Watching ABNB and AMD for the long term purchase. AMD has been running up but if they dip or take a break for awhile I\u0027ll work my way into it. \n\nI like ABNB as a late reopening trade. The name also sounds better than VRBO. I think 10 years from now ABNB will be one of the go to \"hotel\" reservation apps. Plus it\u0027s been chilling at this price range for a few weeks now.","Almost back to even on AMD. Su Bae and me are back together ❤️","Good job MSFT, AMD, and AAPL. I might actually financially recover from joining this place.","AMD wake up from your afternoon nap and jump up to mid 95s plz","AMD forever NVDA for plebs","NVDAs price chart is actually retarded. Can it go anymore parabolic? Cmon AMD catch the fuck up, innovate or some shit...","is amd a good buy rn","my AMD leaps are finally worth more then I paid for them... I.. I don\u0027t know what to do now.. do I.. do I hold until they crash again?  Is this what you want, Market?  DOES THIS MAKE YOU HAPPY?","Any juice left in AMD today?","Indexes and tech AAPL, MSFT, SHOP, AMZN, NVDA, AMD, GOOGL, are all green. Pick better stocks","So what’s up other than AMD rn\n\nHow are indexes green af but all stocks are red","Indexes and tech AAPL, MSFT, SHOP, AMZN, NVDA, AMD, GOOGL, are all green wtf tech are you talking about?","Last stop before AMD moon picking up all retards","YES AMD we are in the money!","Is this why AMD has been down last couple of days? Due to upcoming shares dilution?","Yeah buddy.  Amd too.  I missed my long term option. But f it. Weekly options was great this past week","AMD big daddy today🤓🦍🚀","I would add NVDA to that list because it’s the only reason I still break even. Got some AMD, I’ll check out sentinel one too thanks","Put all your money into SentinelOne and AMD then don\u0027t look at it for 2 years.","[AMD Moves Closer To Acquiring Xilinx](https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/obyzin/amd_moves_closer_to_acquiring_xilinx/)","AMD needs a strong push to break away from $95’s pull","You know, I almost didn\u0027t say this, but just for those struggling, I dumped all my meme money into AMD, and so far, I\u0027m not disappointed.","AMD gamma squeeze possible today? Lots of 95 strike options expiring today.","Amd guys ripping like I said. We still got the Chinese approval catalyst probs coming with earnings and we will move! Best bet is buy calls at the money and then force hedges to buy the stock when they start losing because you’re in the money and they’re not.","AMD keeping my account from ruby red to just slight pink.","Anyone else impressed by AMD? GO BABY GO!!!🚀","Love me some AMD cpu\u0027s!","AMD blasted through 95, what\u0027s next?","Oh shit AMD you\u0027re really doing it.","i took $AMD 100c 7/9 pump that shit","AMD is the new truck","I have shed myself of memes and now worship AMD and AAPL","Thank you AMD and NVDA 😍😍😍","China will approve the deal when the stock price has subdued for a lil bit. Remember those CCP wants to get good calls on AMD before they announce. China inside trades harder then polosi. I see them confirming the deal Q3 end Q4 beginning.","20% profit on shares.\n\nWe will see if your crystal ball gets amd to hit 120\n\n!remindme 1 week","AMD about to bang it\u0027s head on that resistance again.","Rode amd to 95 from 78. Out for now. Gl all","XLNX options suck the bid ask is so fucking wide.

Feels good","movie theater 🍿 bag holders keep down voting me.  Drop the C and get the D.  $AMD baby","AMD will smash 95","Justice Department is looking into them. Amd the SEC.\n\nAnd yes. They lied about the orders and then everyone quit over it.","I\u0027m all in on QQQ/AMD/S and I regret nothing as of right now.\n\n\u0026amp;#x200B;\n\nI may be crying next week.","AMD finally has some momentum. I would wait until it stops going up everyday to sell.","AMD is up today...","Haven\u0027t looked at my Webull account in a while. Suddenly my AMD number is green now. Sheeesh 🚀","Ur on the right track. Pick up some 2022 leap calls for amd if you want safe and high returns","Easily possible but AMD is a fickle mistress. China\u0027s approval on the acquisition will  be a strong catalyst. When that will happen though who knows","AMD gonna hit $100 in July?","Wow AMD sucks","Dear OP, you’re not the first post about this arbitrage. Smart ones already started buying xlnx in anticipation of the merger. You’re absolutely right about xilinx being on a discount right now at 140. Getting 1.7 shares of amd for every xlnx share is like free money for those who buy xlnx at this level. I have 10 shares of xlnx and accumulating more over the next few weeks","I have 49 days for AMD to get past $95 I believe in you","AMD to 95 next week or 07/16?
