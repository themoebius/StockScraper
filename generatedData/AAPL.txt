Either Value or growth. Sometimes you can find a real good company going through some tough times and get a good price. AAPL was at a really good price in 2015-16, down about 20% in about 4 months. BA recently became very cheap when that 2nd plane crashed, **down 73% in 4 weeks.** It\u0027s already back up 150% in 4 months since the bottom. \n\nI try to look for overreactions in the price and get in on the blue chips at a discount. It sounds easier than it is. Timing is everything but with situations like that, you know it\u0027s going to bounce back eventually.
